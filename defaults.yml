# Site information

basePath: ./files           # [String] base path to put all generated assets in
contentPath: /content       # [String] path to main content directory, will nest within `basePath`
pagePath: /pages            # [String] path to regular pages, will nest within `contentPath`

skipImages: false    # [Boolean] skip downloading images altogether. The image processor will always use the cache (unless forceImages is true), but if there are images that consistently return 404/500 errors, the script runs much faster if you don't bother making requests on subsequent runs
