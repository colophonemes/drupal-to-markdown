# Site information
siteURL:          # URL to your existing website. Used to rebuild internal links and to get locally-hosted images. DO NOT include protocol or trailing slash 
siteAssetsURL:          # if your images are all hosted in a particular folder (managed by drupal). DO NOT include protocol or trailing slash
siteProtocol: https # if your site uses HTTPS, use `https`

# Paths to output directories. Paths will be nested within `basepath`
basePath: ./files           # base path to put all generated assets in
contentPath: /content        # path to main content directory, will nest within `basePath`
pagePath: /pages          # path to regular pages, will nest within `contentPath`
storyPath: /posts          # path to blog posts/stories, will nest within `contentPath`
authorPath: /authors        # path to blog authors, will nest within `contentPath`
imagePath: /images/uploads # path to store downloaded images, will nest within `contentPath`
staticSitePath: false             # path to copy the assets to when the script completes (useful if you want to build your static site from another directory)

# limitations
nodeLimit: 30      # how many posts/pages should the script process. Set to zero for no limit/get all posts
skipImages: false   # skip downloading images altogether. The image processor will always use the cache (unless forceImages is true), but if there are images that consistently return 404/500 errors, the script runs much faster if you don't bother making requests on subsequent runs
forceImages: false   # force the script to ignore cached images and try to re-request everything from the server
